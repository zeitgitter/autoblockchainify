# To enable mail tests, please
# - copy this to mailtest.conf
# - edit it according to match a test email account you have access to
# - in the parent directory, run
#   `make test EXTRA_DAEMONOPTS="-c tests/mailtest.conf"`
#   (add further options as you like, e.g. `--debug INFO,mail=XDEBUG`).
#
# The first three addresses should be the same for the loopback test (default).
# For a real-world email test, comment out `stamper-from` and `stamper-to`. Be
# aware that this can produce high load on the Stamper server (even though the
# code should prevent most of it) and that responses from the live server will
# only occur shortly after each full five minutes.
